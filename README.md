!!! For the "calorie counter" to work, you need to use a local web server or static-server (github.com/nbluis/static-server).

The calorie counter allows you to calculate the daily calorie intake for weight loss, maintenance or weight gain. The calculation of calories is based on the following characteristics: gender, age, height, weight and physical activity.

Since the JS-scripts are module based, you need to use a local web-server, such as static-server or use the "live server" capability of your editor, such as VS Code Live Server Extension, to calculate calories.
